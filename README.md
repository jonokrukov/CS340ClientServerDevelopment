# CS-340 Client/Server Development README

**Question:** How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

**Answer:** In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I made sure my code was written with high modularity, explicit explanation, and resuability. The CRUD module I developed separates the database manipulation logic from the rest of the dashboard. This allows changes to be made to the CRUD module without affecting any of the dashboard's logic. My code uses detailed comments alongside consistent naming and style conventions to make its function easy to understand. Documentation is also included to instruct users on how to use the CRUD module and how to integrate it with other code, such as Project Two's dashboard. To ensure resuability, my CRUD module was created with generic create, read, update, and delete functions. This approach means the module can be reused in the future for different projects. For example, any project that requires interaction and manipulation of a MongoDB database can use the CRUD module to perform database functions. 

**Question:** How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

**Answer:** As a computer scientist, approaching a problem, such as the one presented in the Grazioso Salvare project, begins with gathering and developing requirements based on the specific needs of the client. Once the general project requirements have been finalized, the selection of the technologies to be used for your given project can be done. This selection is informed by the previously gathered functional and non-functional requirements. Following this, a rough outline and design of the application to be developed can be created to use as a guideline for the project. Code implementation with this design is the next stage of development. During this, extensive testing of what is written is also done to ensure reliable code that aligns with the project requirements. Modularity is a key consideration during development, as it allows for adaptability should the desires of the client change. In the future, I will continue to use the strategy of reusability, as with the CRUD module. Creating code that can be reused across multiple projects conveys massive advantages for future projects, including reduced development time and increased efficiency.

**Question:** What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

**Answer:** At the most basic level, computer scientists design, develop, and utilize software to solve problems. The work of a computer scientist combines the practical implementation of written code and theoretical analysis to create efficient solutions that could also improve accuracy and capabilities across numerous different fields. This matters because in the present day, the world is becoming increasingly digital, and it is up to computer scientists to drive the advancement of these technologies to improve the quality of life, transform industries, or even push the very boundaries of what we can achieve. The work done on this type of project for Grazioso Salvare could significantly enhance the operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities of companies specializing in the identification and training of rescue animals. The developed dashboard allows users to easily and quickly identify and locate suitable animals based on desired attributes, which can be altered in the dashboard's filters. This alone could theoretically increase the number of suitable rescue animals found on a daily basis.
